This screenshot shows that we incorporated semantic elements in our HTML, including demarcating each section so that it can be tabbed through by the user, as well as H1 and H2 headings in the correct order, which ensured that they would be read out by a screen reader (see below). In addition, we used alt-tags on each image. Being able to tab through the site is especially important for those with sight access requirements, our goal was to minimise the use of div unless we really needed to and utilise other semantic HTML which i believe we achieved but definitely belive we can go back and refactor some of those divs.

## 2. Ensure a web page is readable for screen readers
We aimed to make the website usable by all, including those with disabilities, and to achieve this goal, we employed various techniques to enhance the content's readability for screen readers, thus improving the site's accessibility.

## 3. Ensure our UI has sufficient colour contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably

## 4. Use various tools to check that our website meets accessibility criteria

## 5. Use CSS media queries to ensure our content is always presented effectively on screens of different sizes

## 6. Demonstrate a mobile-first approach to building a website

## 7. Use CSS variables to apply repeated colours to HTML elements

## 8. Use CSS Flexbox to style children in a single-direction layout (ie a row or a column)

## 9. Use CSS Grid to style children in two-direction layout

## 10. Ensure our Git commit history tells a coherent story

## 11. Use the appropriate input types in HTML forms for gathering different types of information
